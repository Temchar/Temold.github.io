    <h1>Robotics</h1>
    <div class="section">
      
      <p>For about 5 years now, I have had the opportunity to participate in the F.I.R.S.T. robotics program. I have been a lead engineer, a team captain; and this year, I have taken up the role of mentor. These roles have helped me develop skills in both leadership, and engineering. However, its best to know where I was, to know how I’ve changed.</p>
		
    
      <p>Starting from the beginning of my time as an FTC team member, I wasn’t a team captain, nor was I the lead engineer. I walked into the room with roughly zero engineering skills and the confidence to fight god, as most 8th graders had. This ended up being my downfall that year; as building robots is, in fact, rather difficult. However, that year did teach me a valuable lesson. It allowed me to properly learn what I was doing, and was helpful in keeping me on the team. Our robot wasn’t anything particularly special, but it worked, as long as we weren’t goofing off.</p>
		
	  <p>Fast forward to year two of robotics, and I was not as confident as I was last year, but this time my confidence was more well placed. Even though a decent portion of our team decided to either quit the team, or move to the other robotics team, I still had some experience building a robot, and used that to my advantage. Due to having new team members, I ended up being both the lead engineer, and the team captain, but team captain comes later. I ended up learning a lot about both engineering, and leadership skills this year, but that will be covered later. My engineering skills grew this year. As not only was I making things in robotics, but I also had Mr. Botteliers class, which taught me the engineering process, and how-to CAD, among other things. This allowed me to hone my skills and have confidence in what I was doing, which had further improvement on my leadership skills.</p>
	  
	  <p>Like I said in the last paragraph my second year on my robotics team, I was also the team captain. This definitely was not a particularly easy, or fun role, as trying to lead a bunch of people younger than you proves difficult as they don’t really see you as true authority, however, I believe I did an okay job overall. Going into it, I had a little bit of a taste of leadership from scouting, but this year I was essentially thrown into the deep end, and I think I definitely suffered because of it. Im not a particularly huge fan of leadership, as being in charge just doesn’t fit well with me, however I do feel that having the experience was very important as it helped me see that I was decent at leadership, despite my hatred for it. </p>
	  
	  <p>Skipping over a few years of engineering experience, and a mild global pandemic, we arrive at this year. Between last year and this one, all but one of my team members quit robotics. I knew that I still wanted to be a part of this team, however I didn’t want to go through the experience of having to not only train a large amount of new kids, but also have to lead a team. I ended up deciding to be a team mentor instead of a team captain. This gave me the freedom from having to truly lead the team, but still allowed me to teach them valuable lessons. While I still don’t have the benefit of hindsight as im still actively participating this year, being a team mentor has been an alright experience overall so far.</p>
	  
	  <p>The robotics program has definitely been an interesting and unique experience for me. It hasn’t always been the most stress free, and there has been plenty of failures, but overall, I feel it has been beneficial. It has helped me learn both leadership and engineering skills better then any class or program I’ve been in, and has helped me in determining what I want to do with my life, and where my hobbies lie.</p><br />
