		<p class="general-info">Hello, my name is Wyatt Smith, and I am a graduating senior at The Dayton Regional STEM School. This digital Portfolio is a record of My Success' and Challenges throughout my 5 years at STEM. My About me page is a way to get to know a bit more about my life outside school, and my experiences tab can help with knowing what I have achieved throughout the years. My projects tabs shows how I've grown since my first days at STEM. <br /><br />Below you can find more about me, and links at the bottom to important exterior pages.</p>

			<p class="general-info">I have been doing robotics through FIRST since 7th grade, and although have struggled a lot in those 5 years, I have also learned alot. The FIRST program has taught me alot about Leadership, team cooperation, and the engineering process. It has given me a chance to express my creativity in a format that mixed well with how I think. I feel the FIRST program and my team have helped shape who I am today.</p>

<br /> <br /><br />
			<p class="general-info">Although robotics has had a significant impact on my life, my scouting life has been one of my longest experiences. I have been in scouting since the 1st grade, and I feel that it has truly helped me discover myself. It definitely hasnt always been a positive thing in my life, however I probably wouldnt be at this school if it had not been for the people I met, and experiences I had while in scouting. I am currently a life scout in the program, and intend to make eagle before I turn 18.</p>
