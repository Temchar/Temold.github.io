<center><h1>11th grade</h1></center>
<h2> really quick summary of this page</h2>
<p> this page is here to show 3 ways ive grown in my eleventh grade year. the first was in planning and design through the launcher project in engineering. the second was in persistance through blender. this third was in procrastination during covid. enjoy, or dont i dont make the rules here</p>

<h1>Rubber band sector artillery</h1>
<p>My first artifact was a project in engineering where we designed and build mechanisms to launch golf balls. The gist of the project was you assembled into groups of 3 or 4 ish and had to design, price materials for, build, and test a launcher. The main requirements were to make sure it was safe, and it had to be relatively cheap. My group consisted of myself, Chris Dooley, Jacob Abrams, and London Ebert. Our design was rather simple. We would build a slingshot with a rail to keep the golf ball strait. Below are some images of our initial design mess. Like how most of my designs go, when written down they only make sense if you were a part of the process. However this design had a lot of merit, because of what is commonly referred to as Occam’s razor. This theory is that the simpler a design is, the less likely it is to fail. This actually was extremely true to this project, as while other groups were getting measurements in inches, our record was 190 feet. Overall I was extremely fond of this project because it helped teach me a lot about how careful planning could lead to tremendous results, and that it is important to display your idea in a way that seems like a human being made it, instead of a swarm of bees with crayons

<h1>Blender</h1>
<p>For my second artifact, we turn to the wonderful, confusing world of blender. More specifically, my ship.blend file.  This file is the product of loads of computer issues, a few headaches, and many, so so so many, merge commands. At the end of it all I was very happy with the result, but I wouldn’t do it again if I had to deal with the computer issues. Anywho, this was just a small part of the yearlong project that has been my capstone project for game design, but I consider it to be the model I am most proud of.  This model originally started work shortly after nearly going insane from making low poly islands (it’s a rather short trip,) and had a soft timeline of maybe a week… boy did that backfire. It ended up taking probably over a month for a not really all that complicated design. The main issues I faced (other than technical issues) was inexperience in both modelling, and building space ships. Ive been doing blender for most of this year, and ive barely scratched the surface of the possibilities for blender, and I constantly am lost when working. Pile that on top of having never really made much in the way of spaceships that were a few bricks stacked together with some bits and bobs thrown in, and I had a rather difficult time making this. Thankfully YouTube came to the rescue, and I managed to learn about different modeling techniques, how to make glass, how to render something in a way that your computer wont explode, basic stuff. Overall this project has been a stressful project that I am glad I did, but never want to redo (mostly for the computer issues)

<h1>Covid and procrastination</h1>
<p> Its no secret that this year has been really, really, REALLY weird. Staying at home was honestly rather difficult for me, not because I wanted to go out and see friends, no im naturally an introvert and prefer a good videogame. It was because I am a HUGE procrastinator, and if there is a short way out, chances are im taking it. This doesn’t really mix well with school and grades. I spent a decent amount of class time playing games, id put off doing school work until last minute (which isn’t exactly any different then normal, I mean im writing this at one in the morning), and generally be really lazy. However once I got back in person (was forced by parents), it all kinda came back to bite me. Not paying attention earlier meant I had trouble understanding content in class, and grades suffered because of it. Thankfully I got my act together somewhat and started actually taking notes, and participating, and actually trying to be a student this year. It also helped that getting a job started eating into my time, causing me to get work done before an hour before it was due, as I would be really tired after work and really not want to homework. Overall I think this year has helped in some part to my procrastination issues, and I hope next year will be better.
