   <h2>Career Exploration Report</h2>

<p>
The first career is mechanical engineering. Mechanical engineering is engineering that involves anything that moves or rotates. Due to this it is arguably on of the most broad and important types of engineering, and ranges from aerospace to nanotech, biotech to robotics. This field of engineering focuses on creating technologies to meet human needs. Each field strives to solve problems related to that field and make improvement to that field. <br />.<br />
	

Mechanical engineers spend their days designing, prototyping, and creating different machines. Due to the broadness of the field, this is about as complex you can get when giving a general description of all mechanical engineering.  If you specialize in a certain field, you will be designing, prototyping, and creating things specific to the field you went into. Mechanical engineers need to be fluent with the tools and programs used, which is where the education comes in.<br />.<br />


When going into mechanical engineering, or any of its subfields, it is mandatory to have knowledge of the engineering process, the programs and tools you use, and so on. If you decide to specialize, you can also get an education for your specific field but most jobs will just require a bachelor in mechanical engineering. <br /><br />


Engineering has always been a hobby of mine. I have enjoyed taking things apart and figuring out how they work ever since I could use tools. I have always enjoyed coming up with ideas of things that I could build with the right parts, and once I learned how to CAD and got a 3d printer, I was able to start making some of the things that I wanted to make. Making things that move was always very cool to me so figuring out that there was a job specifically for that had me excited.<br /><br /><br />

The second career is Robotics engineering. Robotics engineering is a specialization of Mechanical engineering that revolves around the robotics field... obviously. There are two types of robots in the industry. The first is automation robots, which are most your arm robots used in the manufacturing field. The other type is mobile robotics. These are your spot robot dogs from Boston Dynamics, and other robots that look and perform more like something out of a sci-fi film. <br /><br />

Much like mechanical engineers, robotics engineers spend their days CAD’ing, prototyping, assembling, and maintaining robots. Most jobs will have you doing a lot of maintaining, replacing motors and joints when it is needed, and generally being one of the most essential personal to the team, as you are the one who knows how to fix things when they break. <br /><br />

Most jobs in the robotics engineering field take at least a bachelor in Mechanical Engineering. More advanced positions may require either a better education in mechanical engineering, or a degree in robotics engineering. In terms of salary, most robotics engineers make between 60k-120k/year. Of course no entry level engineer will be making 100k+/year, but some of the more senior engineers will.<br /><br />

Now exactly 0.3 of you will be wondering, “how is robotics engineering different from mechanical engineering?” The simple answer is, it mostly is mechanical engineering. Robotics engineering, as I said many times in the other career report, is one of the specializations or subclasses of mechanical engineering. The two jobs spend a lot of time doing the same thing, just to a different outcome.
<br /><br />

In my other report I said how I have always enjoyed engineering, but what really got me onto robotics engineering was my robotics club. During time of writing I am in my 4th year of robotics, and I have really been enjoying it. I am currently the lead engineer and will hopefully stay that way. the program that I do robotics through is FIRST. The robotics club has really allowed me to express my engineering creativity and really put me on a clearer path into engineering and why I enjoyed it.<br />
