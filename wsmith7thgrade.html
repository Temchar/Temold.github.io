	<h2>Greatest Growth Statement</h2>
	<p>Hello, and welcome to my portfolio 7th grade page. Here, I will describe 2 of the projects I have done in the 7th grade. I believe that I grew the most this year in creativity. This is because of the fact that I had alot of projets I worked on that needed this quality, if you werent creative, you would get a lower grade. however I had started okay and gotten better throughout the year. Please check out my stories to learn more.</p><br />

	<center><h3>THE CREATIVE SIDE OF THINGS.</h3>
	
	<p>This year I have grown in many things, one of them being creativity. Creativity is basically how open your mind is. If you have a very open mind, you are very creative. Throughout the year, I have gotten better at the quality of creativity through drawing on adobe illustrator.<br />
<br />
Although I have both grown in and used creativity in many projects. It is clear that that the story book project shows the greatest improvement. The storybook project was a project where we had to write out, and make each picture for our storybook that we had to create. We had to follow the rules of 3 literary techniques, in which we chose circular ending, which is where the story ends similar to the beginning. Conflict resolution strategies. Which are ways to solve a problem between two people, and one of three drawing techniques. We used the drawing with a mouse. Throughout this project i faced many challenges. In the first few drafts I had struggled at drawing on adobe illustrator, which is a program that allows you to use tools to draw and paint. The lines on my first few drafts were dull and had a very bad color scheme. However in the final drafts I had gotten a lot better at this, with adding more lines, detail, and color. My drafts are the best representation of my growth because they show the changes in adobe illustrator.<br />
<br />
Throughout the year I became more creative, which has helped me to draw better on adobe illustrator. At first, I may have struggled in this quality, but over time, I had gotten better and better at drawing. This is important because if  want to be a good artist this would be a very good start. I find that this is important to everyone because if you are creative you can change the way the world things.<br />

	<h4>STILL PUSHING THROUGH</h4>
	<p>“Rules are for the obedience of fools and the guidance of men”, Douglas Bader. Hello, I am Wyatt Smith. Welcome to my portfolio presentation of my lab safety project. Throughout the year, I have grown in many things, one of them being persistence. Persistence is pushing through when things get hard. I have gotten better at persistence through the lab safety project.</p>

<p>The lab safety project is a project in which we had to create a poster to show one of the lab safety rules without using any words. We had to, portray the rule accurately, not have any words, and the final draft must fit on the required paper size. Throughout the project I faced a lot of challenges, however the one that kept popping up was that my lines weren’t strait. Also it was hard to understand. However as I persisted on and I completed more drafts my lines got neater and cleaner. In addition, at the end I feel I had grown a lot in persistance.</p> 

<p>This year I have grown in many ways, one of my greatest growths is in persistence. This project helped me to be neater by having me place the pieces just right to show the lab safety rule. I feel this will help me have more craftsmanship later on because you need to be neat to get into a high ranking job. This can also be applied to other people.</p>
