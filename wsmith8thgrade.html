		<p>Welcome to my 8th grade page. Here you can find some projects I have done this year. The projects I chose for this year are the Skin Color Project, and the Genius Hour Project. Here is a little more about them.</p>
		<h2>Genius Hour</h2>
		<video controls ><source src="GHP.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video><br /><br />
		<p>This video is about my experiences and growths in coding the genius hour projects page for the website. Genius hour is a project where students select a topic that they are interested in and do not know much about. They make a question that they can solve that relates to this topic. They then do research to learn about this topic. After that they make a presentation or website to show what they have learned.<br /><br />	

	Throughout the genius hour I learned about many pieces of code. Some of the things I learned were things like <b>table>, tr>, td></b>, and formatting my page. In my genius hour project, I had used the table elements to format my page. Formatting my page took a while, as I was looking for a way to align my text other than centering it. Finally when I learned about tables I had decided to use tables to format my page, and it ended up looking like this. For my work cited page I had learned about new font types to use for my webpage. </p>

		
		<h2>Skin Color Project</h2>
		<video controls height="360" width="640"><source src="SCP.mp4" type="video/mp4"/></video>
		<p>The skin color projects driving question was “is Kettering diverse?” During the Skin-color project I grew in my knowledge of graphs. I learned about the histogram, box-plot (or box and whisker plot), and scatterplot. The histogram is a set of bars on a graph that show a single set of numerical data. A boxplot is a box that shows median and the interquartile range of a single set of data. The scatter plot is a series of points on a graph that compares two sets of data.<br /><br />

For my 1st graph I used a histogram. For my histogram I looked at population of Kettering by race. It showed that the highest population is the white race, which is around 55,000 people. The second highest population is African Americans, which is around 1500. This showed that Kettering is not very diverse.
<br /><br />
My second graph was a scatter plot. My scatterplot compares income to life expectancy. This showed that the more money you make the higher your life expectancy was. I concluded that is because you can afford better healthcare.
